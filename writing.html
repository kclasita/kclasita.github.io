            Even if you don’t write your own CSS, it’s still important to consider how hard your designs are to turn into a real working website. Luckily, there’s an easy way to strike a balance between design and implementation: Embrace reusable style components.

            A year ago we decided to create an email newsletter for Gaslight. After a successful year, it was time for a more intentional design that integrates with our brand and makes it easier for subscribers to read the content on mobile devices.
