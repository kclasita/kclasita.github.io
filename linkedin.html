            <dt>Prompt:</dt>
            <dd>Design an experience that presents job opportunities to a passive candidate, who is not actively looking for a new position. Find creative solutions that gains the passive candidate's interest in a new position, and garners a response.</dd>
            <dt>Proposed Solution:</dt>
            <dd>Create a new experience on the LinkedIn site that assists the Passive Job Seeker (PJS) in determining future goals in their career. By appealing to the PJS to create goals for their future, recruiters can use this information to up accuracy on interest and increase chance of response. Using this information, more targeted job descriptions go out to a smaller group, limiting the noise of InMail recruiting.</dd>

          <h3>Part 1: User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            Since this prompt encompassed a lot of how I am feeling currently, I wanted to make sure to get an outside perspective to avoid designing for myself. I decided to talk to two people. One I knew had been at her job for a year and was fairly happy. The other has recently switched jobs. I wanted to see where their thoughts overlapped and to capitalize on those.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm including my transcript of our conversations, but I'm summarized the important bits in the next part.

          <h3>Part 2: Key Points + Brainstorm</h3>

          <p>
            The key overlaps I found in interviews were:
            <ol>
              <li>Looking within their current organization for a better position</li>
              <li>Biggest fear was the unknown factors of a new job. Very comfortable and experienced in current roles and responsibilities</li>
              <li> Feel disdain towards a job positing that hadn’t been carefully though through. Was attracted to ones that showed care about who may fill position</li>
              <li>Frustration towards recruiters on LinkedIn. Many wrong job suggestions and some never responded after initial message</li>
              <li> Happy in new position and feel like it was a step up from their old one </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up creating a few pages of questions that helps me focus in on why someone would be interested in switching jobs. I ended up focusing on the fact many people switch jobs to improve their position and learn new skills.
          </p>

          <h3>Part 3: Mindmap + Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I had narrowed in on an idea, I did some work on how the feature would work, what some key components could be, and how both a recruiter and PJS would use the feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            I kicked it off with 20 minutes of brainstorming possible flows, options, and anything that came to my mind. It was just a chance to write again and see what I came up with. I was then able to capture
            <a href="downloads/rough-flow.jpg">a rough PJS flow </a>
            through the product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next I did a timed exercise to get through as many quick variations of
            <a href="downloads/rough-layouts.jpg">possible layouts</a>
            and ideas for how the PJS will use this feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            I moved on to
            <a href="downloads/key-part.pdf">better defining the key parts of this feature.</a>
            I settled on first appealing to the PJS to fill this out by using easy to select prompts. Then I did some work on where the PJS will see this info and how it might be used to present jobs. The last thing I considered was how the recruiter would craft these job postings to the PJS. Overall, it was a good overview.
          </p>

          <p>
            The MVP could be just the first part of creating a ‘career goals’ section on their profile.

          <h3>Part 4: High-fidelity Design</h3>
          <p>
            Here is the final result:
            <a href="downloads/career-goal-mockup.pdf">Passive Job Seeker Mockups.</a>
            It involves sample screen for choosing career goals, integration into areas on the current LinkedIn site, and a Career Goal Connection message from a recruiter. My goal was to integrate with the existing features on the site, but also put my own spin on the new screens.
          </p>

          <p>
            There would also be an area for the recruiters. For my concept, there would be more upfront work for the recruiter to fill out specifics of the job. In return for this details, they would get a list of matches back based how high of a match it is on career goals and current skills. The extra work would create better opportunities. This also would take away the issue of InMail scatter recruiting efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an MVP, we could implement the simple career planning. If that proves to be successful, it can be expanded to include recruiter search and the Career Goal Connections. I want to prove it will be used before adding it to the main navigation.
          </p>

          <h3>Part 5: Thoughts</h3>

          <p>
            I chose to concentrate on desktop because of the short timeframe. Although many of these elements would translate to a small screen size well, I'm afraid a few key areas would need some more thought.
          </p>

          <p>
            I typically don't indicate state changes in my mockups, unless it's a very hard concept to develop. I write my own HTML/CSS code and work closely with developers so I can quickly iterate on the states in app. I'm open to change on this and would like guidance on how bigger teams do this.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd love the chance to sit down and chat about what I think worked and didn't work. I don't feel like I can capture that with words here. Feel free to reach out and chat. I'd love the feedback!
          </p>
