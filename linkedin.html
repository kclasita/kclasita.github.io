            <dt>Prompt:</dt>
            <dd>Design an experience that presents job opportunities to a passive candidate, who is not actively looking for a new position. Find creative solutions that gains the passive candidate's interest in a new position, and garners a response.</dd>
            <dt>Proposed Solution:</dt>
            <dd>Create a new experience on the LinkedIn site that assists the Passive Job Seeker (PJS) in determining future goals in their career. Using this information, more targeted job descriptions go out to a smaller group, limiting the noise of InMail recruiting. This includes an MVP of integrating goal planning into the profile and displaying it. Full vision includes a dedicated area on user home page that displays these opportunities with numbers based on information filled out by company.</dd>

          <h3>Part 1: User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            Since this prompt encompassed a lot of how I am feeling currently, I wanted to make sure to get an outside perspective to avoid designing for myself. I decided to talk to two people. One I knew had been at her job for a year and was fairly happy. The other has recently switched jobs. I wanted to see where their thoughts overlapped and to capitalize on those.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm including my transcript of our conversations, but I'm summarized the important bits in the next part.

          <h3>Part 2: Key Points + Brainstorm</h3>

          <p>
            The key overlaps I found in interviews were:
            <ol>
              <li>Looking within their current organization for a better position</li>
              <li>Biggest fear was the unknown factors of a new job. Very comfortable and experienced in current roles and responsibilities</li>
              <li> Feel disdain towards a job positing that hadn’t been carefully though through. Was attracted to ones that showed care about who may fill position</li>
              <li>Frustration towards recruiters on LinkedIn. Many wrong job suggestions and some never responded after initial message</li>
              <li> Happy in new position and feel like it was a step up from their old one </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up creating a few pages of questions that helps me focus in on why someone would be interested in switching jobs. I ended up focusing on the fact many people switch jobs to improve their position and learn new skills.

          <h3>Part 3: Mindmap + Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I had narrowed in on an idea, I did some work on how the feature would work, what some key components could be, and how both a recruiter and PJS would use the feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            I kicked it off with 20 minutes of brainstorming possible flows, options, and anything that came to my mind. It was just a chance to write again and see what I came up with. I was then able to capture
            <a href="downloads/rough-flow.jpg">a rough PJS flow </a>
            through the product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next I did a timed exercise to get through as many quick variations of
            <a href="downloads/rough-layouts.jpg">possible layouts</a>
            and ideas for how the PJS will use this feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            I moved on to
            <a href="downloads/key-part.pdf">better defining the key parts of this feature.</a>
            I settled on first appealing to the PJS to fill this out by using easy to select prompts. Then I did some work on where the PJS will see this info and how it might be used to present jobs. The last thing I considered was how the recruiter would craft these job postings to the PJS. Overall, it was a good overview.
          </p>

          <p>
            The MVP could be just the first part of creating a ‘career goals’ section on their profile.

            Here is the final result:
            <a href="downloads/key-part.pdf">better defining the key parts of this feature.</a>
            It involves sample screen for choosing career goals, integration in 2 spots on the current LinkedIn site, and the interface for the recruiter.
